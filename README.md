# TargetLocked
My first projectÂ using AvaloniaUI, DynamicData, ReactiveUI, OmniXAML and Microsoft Cognitive Services.

It uses Face API to look for faces in videos.

In order to build the solution you will need a Face API key, that you can get here: https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=/products/54d85c5b5eefd00dc474a0f0

After you got the Face API, 
1. create a FaceApi.txt file in the Desktop project
2. set its `Build Action` to `None`
.3 Set its `Copy to output folder` option to `Copy If Newer`
